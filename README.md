Meckt is a tool whose goal is making total conversion mod easier and less cumbersome. It includes tools to generate provinces from the provinces image, to create and edit titles using a user interface and a map, to manage the history of titles.

## Compiling

### Linux

1. Clone the repository (with submodules):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Xorrad/meckt.git
```

2. Install SFML using the package manager:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

3. In `vendor/includes/imgui/imgui/misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.cpp` replace line 10 with:
```cpp
#include "../../imgui.h"
```

4. Compile and run *meckt* using:
```bash
make
```


### Windows

1. Clone the repository (with submodules):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Xorrad/meckt.git
```

2. Download [SFML 2.6.2](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.2/).  
Extract the downloaded package into the `vendor/sfml/` directory so that the folder structure looks like:
```
vendor/sfml/include
vendor/sfml/lib
...
```

3. Install Make and a compatible C++ compiler for Windows.  
A good starting point is to use the [w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit), which includes both.

4. In `vendor/includes/imgui/imgui/misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.cpp` replace line 10 with:
```cpp
#include "../../imgui.h"
```

5. Compile and run *meckt* using:
```bash
make
```
