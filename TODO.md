# Bug Fixes
- Fix wrong title texture send to shader after unwrapping/wrapping titles

# Features
- Change provinces.png pixels to new provinces color when exporting
- Add culture and faith map modes

- Add button to change a province sea-zone for port
- Add button to fix provinces ids if they are not sequential

# Improvements
- Support harmonizing colors for provinces
- Automatically assign province flags (using heightmap) when generating provinces

- Import cultures and religions for autocompletion
- Add button to merge provinces/titles of same type
- Change UI colors and style
- Keep the order of keys after parsing and when exporting
